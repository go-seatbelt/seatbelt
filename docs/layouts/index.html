    <p>Seatbelt is a Go web framework used at <a href="https://mart.ai">Mart.ai</a> that allows us to:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Develop new features as quickly as possible,</li>
      <li>Manage existing features as the grow, and</li>
      <li>Maintain successful features long term.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>We think Seatbelt is pretty great, and we hope you will too. Check back in a month or two for the official launch.</p>
