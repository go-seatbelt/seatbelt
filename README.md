# Seatbelt

An MVC web framework for Go that balances upfront productivity with long term maintability.

Inspired by Ruby on Rails.

### Usage

Don't use this yet. It's too early.

### Notes

1. Static assets are always served from `public`.
2. HTML templates go in `views`. If a `layout.html` is present, that is used as a layout file.
